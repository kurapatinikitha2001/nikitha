    <h1 id="top">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The introductory applications-oriented course could cover the :Foundations chapters, then the Application Development chapters, followed by the overview systems chapters, and conclude with the Database Design and Tuning material. Chapter dependencies have been kept to a minimum, enabling instructors to easily fine tune what material to include. The Foundations material, Part I, should be covered first, and within Parts III, IV, and V, the overview chapters should be covered first. The only remaining dependencies between chapters in Parts I to VI are shown as arrows in Figure 0.2. The chapters in Part I should be covered in sequence. However, the coverage of algebra and calculus can be skipped in order to get to SQL queries sooner (although we believe this material is important and recommend that it should be covered before SQL).
The introductory systems-oriented course would cover the Foundations chapters and a selection of Applications and Systems chapters. An important point for systems-oriented courses is that the timing of programming projects (e.g., using Minibase) makes it desirable to cover some systems topics early. Chapter dependencies have been carefully limited to allow the Systems chapters to be covered as soon as Chapters 1 and 3 have been covered. The remaining Foundations chapters and Applications chapters can be covered subsequently.
